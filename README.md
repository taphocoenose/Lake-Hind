# Lake-Hind

This R script uses BChron to create a Bayesian age-depth model for the radiocarbon dates published by Teller et al. (2019). In addition to BChron, LakeHindDates.R requires the ggplot2 and patchwork packages for plotting. BChron and ggplot2 are available in the CRAN, and patchwork is available at https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork.

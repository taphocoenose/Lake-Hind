# Lake-Hind

LakeHindDates.R uses <i>Bchron</i> to create a Bayesian age-depth model for the radiocarbon dates published by Teller et al. (2019). In addition to <i>Bchron</i>, this script requires the <i>ggplot2</i> and <i>patchwork</i> packages for plotting. <i>Bchron</i> and <i>ggplot2</i> are available in the CRAN, and <i>patchwork</i> is available at https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork.

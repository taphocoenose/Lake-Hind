# Lake-Hind

These R scripts use the <i>Bchron</i> and <i>rbacon</i> packages to create Bayesian age-depth models for the radiocarbon dates published by Teller et al. (2019, Table 1). These dates are contained within LakeHindDates.csv. In addition to <i>Bchron</i> and <i>rbacon</i>, these scripts require the <i>ggplot2</i> and <i>patchwork</i> packages for plotting. <i>Bchron</i>, <i>rbacon</i>, and <i>ggplot2</i> are available on CRAN, and <i>patchwork</i> is available at https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork.
